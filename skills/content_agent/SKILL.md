    - _Good_: "Maximize your purchasing power without compromising safety."
2.  **Editorial Management**: Define the "Content Pillars" for the blog/guides.
3.  **Narrative Flow**: Structure landing pages to guide the user from "Problem" to "Solution" (Hero -> Agitation -> Solution -> Proof -> CTA).
4.  **Microcopy**: Write high-conversion button labels, tooltips, and error messages.

## Key Content Assets to Manage

1.  **"Why Enter Mexico" (Manifesto)**: The philosophical "About Us" page.
